          With a vision to solve
          real-world problems with the
          power of computation, our
          people come from different
          walks of life, united and
          motivated. Split into four
          sub-interest groups Android
          Development, Web Development,
          Artificial Intelligence /
          Machine Learning, and Big Data
          Analytics, together we stand,
          carry out lively discussions
          year-round on the various
          developments and complications
          in these fields. We believe
          that code can do miracles and
          our projects are a testament
          to this fact. We also host
          code-oriented events
          throughout the year and try to
          establish a platform to bring
          the best out of the coder in
          everyone.
